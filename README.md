## Example

### Import pyqpp, pystaq and numpy into the scope


```python
from pystaq import *
from pyqpp import *
import numpy as np
```

### Build a quantum circuit and apply gates


```python
circuit = QCircuit(1, 1)  # qubit quantum circuit with one qubit, one classical bit
circuit.gate(gates.H, 0); # Hadamard gate on the first qubit
```

### Measure the qubit and store the result in the first classical bit


```python
circuit.measureZ(0, 0);
```

### Construct an engine


```python
engine = QEngine(circuit)
```

### Execute the circuit repeatedly and display the statistics


```python
engine.execute(100)
```




    [QEngine]
    <QCircuit nq: 1, nc: 1, d: 2>
    last probs: [0.5]
    last dits: [0]
    stats:
    	reps: 100
    	outcomes: 2
    	[0]: 54
    	[1]: 46



How cool is this! ðŸ˜Š
